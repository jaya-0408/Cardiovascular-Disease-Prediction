### Objective:
Prepare a comprehensive data analysis report on the provided dataset and develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases in individuals. Evaluate and compare the performance of multiple models to recommend the most effective one.

### Project Tasks:
  - Conduct a thorough data analysis on the dataset.
  - Build a predictive model using machine learning algorithms.
  - Assess and report the performance metrics of each model.
  - Recommend the best model for predicting cardiovascular diseases.

### Dataset Details:
 age: Age of the person (in years)
 sex: Gender of the person (1 = male; 0 = female)
 chest_pain_type: Type of chest pain
    0: Typical angina
    1: Atypical angina
    2: Non-anginal pain
    3: Asymptomatic
 resting_bp: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
 cholesterol: Serum cholesterol level (mg/dl)
 fasting_blood_sugar: Fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
 restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results
    0: Normal
    1: ST-T wave abnormality
    2: Probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estesâ€™ criteria
 max_hr: Maximum heart rate achieved
 exang: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
 oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
 slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
    0: Upsloping
    1: Flat
    2: Downsloping
 num_major_vessels: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0-3)
